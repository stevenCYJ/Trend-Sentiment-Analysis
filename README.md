# Trend-Sentiment-Analysis
This repo is an archived clone of my CS 506 Final Project. 
We worked with our client GDIGM to analyze the sentiment trends over the period 2004-2021.
to see how their works perfomed on arousing the social awareness of Gender equality.
We made several sentiment analysis based on their internal datasets as well as google trends.
